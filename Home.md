> - Student: at **University of Missouri**.
> - Major: IT
>> I transferred into IT after Computer Science when I learned that I wanted to do more than just Code. IT 1000 is my first class in the department and I am enjoying it a lot. Click *[here](https://engineering.missouri.edu/academics/it/)* to learn more about Mizzou's IT department.
>> To see some code I made during the semester click *[here](https://github.com/CzeschinW/IT1000-Final/blob/main/fizzbuzz%20(1).html)*

I'm from St. Charles, MO a city just outside of St. Louis. I went to *Duchesne High School* where I played Football and Volleyball and Graduated in 2019.

At Mizzou I spent my first year finding a degree and joining a fraternity. I joined Theta Chi in the fall of my freshman year and now serve as the New Member Educator.

I currently work at AL Gustin golf course as a part of the grounds crew where I maintain the course. I know there are probably easier jobs that pay more in the area but I enjoy working outside during the summer and I get free golf.

##### Future Plans:
1. Continue to study IT at Mizzou
2. Work an IT related internship by graduation
3. Decide between Cyber-Security or Network architecture.
4. Enjoy the rest of my life.
